# planar_cnp

Identifying influencer nodes in planar networks.
This is C++ implementation of the method defined in Purevsuren, D., Cui, G., 2019. Efficient heuristic algorithm for identifying critical nodes in planar networks. Computers & Operations Research 106, 143â€“153. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2019.02.006.

The implementation is based on Boost Graph Library.
